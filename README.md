# Discrete Fourier Transform
A program to compute DFT of a given signal

## Input:
Enter the number of samples in your signal in the first line.  
Enter the sample values of your signal in the second line.  

### Example: 
```
4
1 1 -1 0 
```
## Output:
The output will contain the same number of samples after applying **DFT** to it.  
Each sample will be represented in complex numbers.
complex number will be written in the format of (real, imag).
### Example:
- 1 + 1i &rarr; (1, -1)
- -i     &rarr; (0, -1); 

## Demo:
### input:
```
4
1 1 -1 0 
```
### output:
```
(1,0) (2,-1) (-1,0) (2,1) 
```
